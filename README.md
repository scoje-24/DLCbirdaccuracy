# Bird point marker

Hello! Thank you for being willing to take part in this project. The data from the points you place will be used to confirm if a machine learning model is able to approximate human labelling accuracy. Even if you are not able to get through all of the provided images, any data will help and is appreciated!

There are 6 potential points to place on each image: 
"topBeaktip": the pointed tip of the top beak

"botBeaktip": the pointed tip of the bottom beak

"rightHinge": where the two halves of the beak meet on the right side (right side = bird’s right = your left (i.e. bird is facing right)) 

"leftHinge":  where the two halves of the beak meet on the left side (left side = bird’s left = your right (i.e. bird is facing left)) 

"leftEye": center of the left eye (left side = bird’s left = your right) 

“rightEye”: center of the right eye (right side = bird’s right = your left) 

If one or more of these locations is not visable on your image, please do not place that point on the image.

When you have labelled all of the images, click "Download CSV" and email the generated CSV to me at jscot24@ilstu.edu
